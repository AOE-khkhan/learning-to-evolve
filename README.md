## Usage

There are five relevant scripts. For details, consult the respective readme files under readme/ or use --help.

* apply_solver.py _config-file_  
Reads parameters from the provided _config-file_ to generate evolutionary algorithms.  
These evolutionary algorithms can then be trained and/or validated on problem sets.
The default config file can be found under data/

* evaluation/plot_stats.py [options] _output-file_ _input-files_  
Reads data from stats.npy files generated by apply_solver.py (_input-files_), generates a plot and stores it in _output-file_.  
Each file must assigned a label, using _--label_ in the order of the _input-files_.  
Can be used in two modes:  
  * Normal mode:
  Creates a generation vs fitness graph per input stats file.
  * Training progress mode:
  Creates a training iteration vs terminal fitness graph per input (_input_files_ must be folders containing stats files)

* evaluation/print_stats.py [options] _input-files_  
Reads data from stats.npy files generated by apply_solver.py (_input-files) and prints performance statistics.  
The --g option must be used to specify the generations to print statistics about.  
Can be used in two modes:
  * Normal mode:
  Prints statistics per element of _input-files_
  * Merge mode:
  Combines all stats.npy files contained in the _input-files_ (must be folder names) and prints overall statistics.

* evaluation/generate_knapsack.py [options] _output-file_  
Generates a set of problem instances for the 0-1 knapsack problem and stores them as a .json-file _output-file_, for later use by apply_solver.

* evaluation/generate_tsp.py [options] _output-file_  
Generates a set of problem instances for the traveling salesman problem and stores them as a .json-file _output-file_, for later use by apply_solver.
